# Machine-Learning-ModelDeployment
Repository containing portfolio of machine learning projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of python files

## Instructions for Running Python files Locally
Run the python file as usual by using a either **vscode, spynder or pycharm** Python IDEs.

## Installations and creations

Using anacoda create a virtual environment and install the following packagaes

**pickle** `pip install pickle` for loading saved model

**pickle** `pip install picke-mixin` for python 3.8

**streamlit** `pip install streamlit` for web app


### Contents
  ### Diabetes Predictive System
  This project has used streamitlit to create a predictive sytem where the user can enter various variables that determine if a patient has diabetes or not.
  
  The following files potrays the nature of the system:
  
  * [trained_model.sav](https://github.com/MutegiMk/ModelDeployment/blob/main/trained_model.sav): This model was created using support vector Machine(SVM) 
    in google Colab using diabetes dataset that can be found at kaggle and its was able to predict if the patient was diabetic or not but it had 0.78 accuracy which was     fairly great factoring it was a small dataset.
    
  * [predictive system.py](https://github.com/MutegiMk/ModelDeployment/blob/main/predictive%20system.py): This python file was created in aid of using the trained\saved model where new data was given and result was accurately given. 
   
   * [Diabetes
